# Algorithms Visualizer Program
![](Media/Front_Page.png)

This program's main idea is to visualize pathfinding algorithms on graphs.  
The three main algorithms for this project are:
* Dijkstra's algorithm.
* BFS algorithm.
* DFS algorithm.

Few functions this program has:
* Change speed of the running algorithm.
* Add desired weight to each edge.
* Drag and drop nodes.
* Clear canvas to start over.
* Reset the colors of the graph (after the algorithm ran and changed the colors of the graph).

Basic utilization of the program:

This programs includes a drag and drop function:
